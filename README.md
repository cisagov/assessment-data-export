`assessment-data-export` contains code to export assessment data from a Jira
server and upload that data to an AWS S3 bucket as a JSON file.

Our terraform code to create the S3 bucket can be found in
[https://github.com/cisagov/assessment-data-import-terraform](https://github.com/cisagov/assessment-data-import-terraform)

## Usage ##

To run this script, you first must create a file with the credentials
needed to access your Jira server.  It's a best practice to use a dedicated
Jira account that has only the permissions needed to access the data to be
exported.  The Jira credentials file has the following simple format:

```console
my_jira_username
my_jira_password
```

Issue the following command to run the script:

```console
src/ade/assessment_data_export.py --jira-base-url=https://my-jira-server
--jira-credentials-file=my_jira_creds.txt --jira-filter=12345
--s3-bucket=my-bucket --output-filename=assessment-data.json
```

To get help information on the command line arguments, run:

```console
./assessment_data_export.py -h
```
